/* Channel Semantics
- send/receive to/from a channel will block until opposite opporation(*) (until something receives from the channel)
	- guarantee of delivery - receive set up before the send
- receive from a closed channel will return zero without blocking
	- use "comma ok" to check if channel was closed
- send to a closed channel - will panic.
- dont have to close channels in go - not a memory leak
- closing a closed or nil channel will panic
- send/receive to a nil channel will block forever.
